# Create Synthetic Speech Using Text to Speech

The Text-to-Speech API lets you create audio files of machine-generated, or synthetic, human speech. You provide the content as text or Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), specify a voice (a unique 'speaker' of a language with a distinctive tone and accent), and configure the output; the Text-to-Speech API returns to you the content that you sent as spoken word, audio data, delivered by the voice that you specified.

In this project, I create a series of audio files using the Text-to-Speech API, then listen to them to compare the differences.
